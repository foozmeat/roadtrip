# Road Trip

![image](images/screenshot.png)

### Features

* Reads your iTunes playlists
* Conversion to MP3
* M3U playlist creation
* Album artwork scaling

### Building

There's a pre-built copy of ffmpeg included as well as a script to download and build a new copy. You'll need to install cocopods as well.

**IMPORTANT:** Road Trip used the iTunes framework which requires sandboxing. You'll need to have valid Devleoper ID signing credentials in order to build and run Road Trip. **I can't provide you with a pre-built app as I no longer have Developer ID signing credentials.**
